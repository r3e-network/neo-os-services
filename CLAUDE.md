## Repository: neo-os-services

This is the NeoOS confidential services stack repository.

Primary responsibilities:

- Morpheus-compatible Neo N3 oracle/datafeed protocol
- Edge and control planes, relayers
- Nitro execution workers
- Signer custody service (key custody authority)
- Operator web application
- Cloudflare edge gateway and control plane
- Supabase durable state management
- Confidential execution plane (Oracle CVM, DataFeed CVM)
- Network registry and identity authority
- Durable service kernel (jobs, callbacks, relay policy)

This repo should NOT:

- Own contract source code (owned by neo-os-contracts)
- Own MiniApp source code (owned by neo-os-miniapps)
- Own MiniGame source code (owned by neo-os-minigames)
- Own wallet/session UI (owned by neo-os-web)
- Restate network identities as literals (use config/networks projection)
- Hold user wallets (user keys stay in neo-os-app, never service keys)
- Add signing call sites without reviewing docs/SIGNER_SERVICE.md §7
- Own NeoDID registry protocol (owned by neo-os-did; this repo runs pinned consumer copies)

Architecture boundary:

- Owns C14 deliver, C15 compute, C17 ingress (v2 layer L3 gateway)
- Hosts C05 oracle; C04/C16 identity owned by neo-os-did
- Service keys and custody live here exclusively
- NeoDID consumer files are pinned copies from neo-os-did

# Global Claude Code Rules

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **ALWAYS** write tests BEFORE implementing any feature or fixing any bug
- Tests must be written first and must fail initially
- Implementation should only contain code necessary to make tests pass
- Every function, method, and class must have comprehensive test coverage
- Include unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases
- Tests must be executable and verifiable
- Test coverage must be at least 90% for all code
- Include performance tests for critical paths
- Write tests for both success and failure scenarios

### 2. Document-Driven Development (DDD)

- **ALWAYS** create documentation BEFORE writing code
- Documentation must include:
  - Purpose and problem being solved
  - API design and interfaces
  - Data structures and schemas
  - Error handling strategies
  - Performance considerations
  - Security implications
  - Usage examples with expected outputs
  - Migration guides for breaking changes
  - Deployment instructions
- Documentation must be kept in sync with code changes
- Include inline documentation for complex logic
- API documentation must include request/response examples

### 3. Production-Ready Code Only

- **NO PLACEHOLDERS** of any kind are allowed:
  - No `TODO` comments without immediate implementation
  - No `console.log` for debugging (use proper logging)
  - No hardcoded values (use configuration)
  - No mock data in production code
  - No simplified implementations
  - No stub functions
  - No "coming soon" features
  - No commented-out code
  - No incomplete error handling

❌ Bad:

- `feat: added feature as requested by user via Claude`
- `fix: AI-generated fix for bug`
- `update: changes made by assistant`
- `🤖 Generated with Claude Code`
